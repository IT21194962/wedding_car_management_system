# wedding_car_management_system
A wedding car management system is a software application that allows users to manage the cars and transportation logistics for a wedding event. In a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, the application would be developed using these technologies.

Here's a high-level description of the different components of the system:

MongoDB: The database to store all the data related to the cars, drivers, bookings, and customers.
Express.js: A web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and responses, and to build the API layer for the application.
React.js: A frontend library to build the user interface and provide an interactive experience for users to manage the wedding cars.
Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that runs the backend of the application and interacts with the database to fetch and store data.
Authentication and Authorization: The system would have an authentication and authorization layer to ensure only authorized users can access the system, and the access controls are set up to restrict what actions each user can perform.
Car Management: The system would allow administrators to manage the cars available for the wedding event, including details such as the car type, model, year, availability, and price.
Booking Management: The system would allow customers to book cars for their wedding event, select the date and time, choose the car and driver, and make a payment.
Reporting: The system would have a reporting module to generate reports such as the number of bookings, revenue, and car availability for the upcoming weeks.

Overall, a wedding car management system built using the MERN stack would provide an efficient and user-friendly way to manage the cars and transportation logistics for a wedding event.
